### Python Strategies

This project tries to emulate the behaviour of Metatrader platform, so its objective is to give us a better understanding about if a trading bot is profitable or not.

As input it takes a file which contains the historic candles data of some stock market, and as a result it give us a file with all the trading positions it did and the final profit.

It has a checkpoint system and It uses the multiprocesing pool to improve the time taken by the backtest.

This project inits from the tester.py file
